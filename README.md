# Python Socket Programming

This repository contains two key projects demonstrating the power of socket programming in Python. It showcases a network bandwidth monitor and a basic client-server application using threading for concurrent connections.

## Projects

### Bandwidth Monitor

The `bandwidth-monitor` directory houses a Python script (`bandwidth.py`) that provides real-time network bandwidth monitoring.

#### Features:
- Real-time upload and download speeds
- Graphical representation of network usage (Screenshots in the `ss` folder)

#### How to Run:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then run the following command in your terminal:
